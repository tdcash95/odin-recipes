    <h1>Fall Cider Mule</h1>
    <img src="images/fall-cider-mule.jpeg" alt="Fall Cider Mule">
    <p>The Moscow mule just got a yummy upgrade for fall! This is a fun new way to enjoy one of our favorite drinks. Warm, subtle spice from apple cider is brightened up by fresh lime juice and a little "bite" from the ginger and Tito's® vodka-it's perfectly sweet and refreshing.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>Ginger Syrup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh ginger </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Mules</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ cup freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups sparkling apple cider</li>
        <li>1 cup vodka (such as Tito's®)</li>
        <li>1 medium lime, cut into 4 wedges</li>
        <li>4 cups ice, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sugar, water, and ginger in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, and stir constantly until sugar is dissolved. Remove from heat and strain into a pitcher; discard solids. Let cool completely, 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/4 cup cooled ginger syrup into a separate pitcher; reserve remaining ginger syrup for a later use. Stir in lime juice, sparkling cider, and vodka. Pour into 4 ice-filled glasses and garnish with lime wedges.</li>
